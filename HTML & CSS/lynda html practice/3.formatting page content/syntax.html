    <p>Because HTML is often the people’s first experience with coding, there can be a fair amount of apprehension about learning it. Thankfully, HTML syntax is relatively simple and easy to learn. Most people can learn the basics of HTML and begin coding it within the same day.

    <h3>A markup language</h3>
    <p>HTML is a markup language. That means that content on the page is “marked up” by tags which identify the content inside of them. A paragraph, for example, can be identified by placing the &ldquo;&lt;p&gt;&rdquo; opening tag prior to the paragraphs content and the &ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&rdquo; closing tag at the end of a paragraph. The full paragraph would look like this:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
